      <p style = "font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;">Hello, my name is Andres Mills Gallego.  I am a first generation immigrant and am originally from Colombia, South America. I am a lifelong woodworker who thrives on learning new things.  Before I decided to learn software development, I worked in construction.  My strengths were  problem solving and implementing the client’s vision. About a year ago I decided to go back to school and complete my Associate of Arts degree at Seattle Central.  Having worked in construction my entire life, I was ready for a change and excited to take the next steps.  I was quickly drawn to software development, as it offered a lot of the same things that I knew already, were of interest to me. </p>

      <p style = "font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;">I’ve worked in the medical lab field for over 10 years and became interested in coding a few years ago. The arrival of covid gave me the opportunity and push I needed to enroll in Code Fellows and I’m glad I did! What started out as a curiosity has turned into a new pursuit in becoming a full stack developer. My hope is to eventually merge my lab experience with the software development skills I gain at Code Fellows to help create software that will be useful in the medical lab industry.</p>
