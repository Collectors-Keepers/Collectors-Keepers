# Requirements of Software

### Vision 

The vision of this product is to allow users to store, compare, and sell the various collections that they have.<br/>
This solves the pain point of users not having a dedicated website to host their collections, as well as allowing users to buy or sell items and interact with the collections of other users. <br/>
There are many collectors out there who are passionate about the items they collect and the communities that can be formed around those collections. This product will allow the dedicated collector to interact with others just like them, as well as non-collectors who are holding collectible items and wishing to sell them. <br/>

### Scope 

**In** 
- this product will allow users to upload individual items to their collection and store them digitally. 
- Users will be able to see the collections of others in the catalog. 
- Users will be able to compare prices of listed collectibles in the catalog. 
- Users will be able to like the collections or collectibles of others. 
- Add objects into a "want list"
**Out**
- payment processor platform. 


### MVP

Minimum functionality is the storage of individual items into a collection for a user. There will be some preloaded collections into the local storage for presentation purposes. These multiple different collections will then be rendered into one combined catalog. Allow users to upload files to their collection. Allows users to like items or entire collections from the catalog. 

Stretch goals:
- make the catalog sortable(name, price, for sale, etc); 
- allow for communication between users. 
- allow users to generate their own types of collections (with different properties being necessary for each type of collection).

### Functional Requirements 
1. Users can upload data/files
2. data will be stored locally 
3. data will be rendered on the catalog
4. users can view data rendered to the catalog. 

### DataFlow
1. User opens home page, here they can see some of the catalog, as well as a walkthrough of how to make a catalog. 
2. the user can then link to either the make a collection or view the catalog pages of the website. 
3. for the make a collection page, the user will then input their individual items to their collection. When submitted, their collection will then push to the catalog. 
4. For the view catalog page, the user will be able to see all of the data that has been rendered to the catalog thus far.
